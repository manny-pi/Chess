# Games 

## What is the Games repo? 
The Games repo is a collection of all the games I'll ever build

## Why did you make the repo? 
Because I want to share with people. Code is for the world! 

## What do you want to achieve? 
Obviously, I want to improve my skills as a programmer, and sometimes its hard to find projects that are worthwhile.
That's where games come in! You can never run out of ideas for games, and you can be certain that for every game, 
there's a nuance or subtlety that separates it from the others
