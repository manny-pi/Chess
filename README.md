# Games by manny-pi

## What is the Games repo? 
Games is a collection of all my video-game-related side projects. At the moment all my games have been developed in PyGame using Python,
but that will likely change (soon)! 

## Why did you make the repo? 
Because I want to share with people. Code is for the world! And because I want to people to make useful changes to the games, 
so I can learn from their implementations, and evolve my own as well. 

Also, putting my projects on GitHub makes me feel like I'm part of a weird-cybernetic community. Its f* meta 

## What else can we expect you to include in this repo? 
I'm not sure yet. I'm currently a Data Scientist and independent Machine Learning researcher (meaning I have no academic sponsorship for my work), 
so if I'm going to add anything to this repo - other than what's here already - it'll probably related to my research. 

But that's why I have you guys! Add as much stuff as you like. And I STRONGLY encourage you to use best-practices so anyone visiting can 
learn from your implementations.
